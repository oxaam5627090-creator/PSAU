# Saudi Academic AI Assistant

This repository provides a starter implementation for "دليلك الجامعي"—a Najdi Arabic academic assistant that runs fully on-premise for Saudi universities. It includes a Node.js/Express backend, a React frontend, Python-based document processing utilities, and scaffolding for fine-tuning a compact LLM through Ollama.

## Backend Overview

* **Authentication** via JWT (student ID + password).
* **Chat orchestration** integrates student memory, university schedule, and Ollama responses.
* **File uploads** (PDF, DOCX, PPT/PPTX, images) up to 2.5 MB, routed to a Python extractor that uses LangChain loaders and Tesseract OCR.
* **Personalization** stores per-user summaries and facts, refreshing the system prompt each turn.
* **Admin dashboard** exposes aggregate counts, latest uploads, and potential fine-tuning sources.
* **Automated cleanup** removes uploads older than one week through a cron task.

Key entry points:

* `backend/server.js` – Express server bootstrap
* `backend/routes/*.js` – Auth, chat, uploads, admin endpoints
* `backend/controllers/*.js` – Business logic for each route group
* `backend/utils/` – Ollama client, prompt builder, summarizer, file extractor, JWT middleware
* `backend/utils/text_extractor.py` – LangChain/Tesseract-powered document parsing utility

Install dependencies with:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Run the API (after configuring `.env`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server listens on `PORT` (default `4000`).

## Frontend Overview

The Vite React app implements login, student dashboard, chat interface, and admin view.

* `frontend/src/App.jsx` – Router setup for Login, Dashboard, Chat, Admin pages
* `frontend/src/pages/*.jsx` – Page components styled for RTL Arabic
* `frontend/src/styles/` – Global and per-page CSS

To run the SPA:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` requests to the backend by default.

## Database Schema

Import `database/schema.sql` into MySQL (or compatible server) to create required tables:

```sql
SOURCE database/schema.sql;
```

Tables:

* `users` – student profiles, hashed credentials, schedules, persisted memories
* `chats` – JSON chat transcripts plus summarised memory strings
* `uploads` – metadata for temporary storage files

## Fine-Tuning Workflow

1. Place curated university policy documents under `data/university_docs/`.
2. Ensure a compatible base model exists in `models/base_model/` (e.g., `llama3.2-3b-instruct-q4` from Ollama or LM Studio).
3. Configure Python dependencies (PyTorch, bitsandbytes, PEFT, transformers, accelerate).
4. Run LoRA/QLoRA training via WSL using `scripts/finetune.py` (provided below) or adapt to your pipeline:

```bash
accelerate launch scripts/finetune.py \
  --base_model ./models/base_model \
  --data_path ./data/university_docs \
  --output_dir ./models/fine_tuned
```

5. After training, update Ollama/LM Studio to reference the fine-tuned weights and adjust `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `.env`.

### scripts/finetune.py

A reference script is available under `scripts/finetune.py` (see repo). It demonstrates preparing LoRA adapters for a causal language model using data in JSONL or text format.

## Updating the System Prompt

Modify `backend/utils/promptBuilder.js` to tweak tone or inject additional context. Environment variables (`MEMORY_TOKEN_LIMIT`) control how much student memory is appended per request.

## Reloading or Replacing the Model

1. Stop the backend server.
2. Update Ollama (or LM Studio) with the new model tag or weights.
3. Edit `.env` → `OLLAMA_MODEL` and restart `npm run dev` (backend) to pick up the change.

## Deployment Notes

* Designed for Windows 11 with WSL for backend Python tooling; Node/React can run on Windows or WSL.
* GPU inference via Ollama or LM Studio using GTX 1080 Ti and 24 GB RAM; expect ~1–3 s per response with quantized 3B–7B models.
* For LAN/public access, configure reverse proxy (e.g., Caddy/NGINX) and HTTPS certificates.
* Optional Bing/Serper web search can be toggled by `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=true` and providing an API key; integrate the logic in `backend/utils/ollamaClient.js` or dedicated module.

## Cron-Based File Retention

`backend/cronDelete.js` schedules hourly cleanup of uploads older than seven days. Ensure the process stays active (use PM2, systemd, or Windows Task Scheduler if running as a service).

## Environment Configuration

Duplicate `.env.example` → `.env` and adjust credentials. Default upload path (`backend/uploads`) is relative to repo root.

## Running Locally on Windows 11

The project is designed to run fully on a Windows workstation that leverages WSL for Linux tooling and either Ollama or LM Studio for the language model runtime. The checklist below walks through a clean setup:

1. **Install WSL** (if you have not already):
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```
   Restart Windows when prompted and create a Unix username/password during the first boot of Ubuntu.

2. **Update the WSL distribution** (inside the Ubuntu terminal):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. **Install base tooling inside WSL**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip git
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```
   Node 20+ is recommended for the backend/frontend and ships with npm.

4. **Clone the repository into WSL** (or copy it into your WSL home directory):
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url> saudi-ai-assistant
   cd saudi-ai-assistant
   ```

5. **Provision MySQL** (choose one of the following):
   - Install MySQL directly on Windows (MySQL Installer) and expose it on `localhost`.
   - _or_ install MariaDB inside WSL:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install -y mariadb-server
     sudo service mariadb start
     sudo mysql_secure_installation
     ```
   Import `database/schema.sql` once the server is running:
   ```bash
   mysql -u <user> -p < database/schema.sql
   ```

6. **Install Ollama or LM Studio on Windows** (outside of WSL) and download a compatible quantized model such as `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_0` or `mistral:7b-instruct-q4`. Ensure the service listens on `http://localhost:11434` (default for Ollama). If you run LM Studio instead, note the server URL and update `.env` accordingly.

7. **Create and configure the environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```
   Set database credentials, JWT secret, upload directory, and the Ollama host/model. Example values:
   ```dotenv
   OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_0
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_USER=wsldbuser
   DB_PASSWORD=super-secret
   DB_NAME=saudi_assistant
   ```

8. **Install backend dependencies** inside WSL:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   Keep this terminal open for running the API server later.

9. **Install frontend dependencies** in a new WSL terminal tab/window:
   ```bash
   cd ~/saudi-ai-assistant/frontend
   npm install
   ```

10. **Set up the Python environment for document extraction** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    cd ~/saudi-ai-assistant/backend
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install langchain pymupdf python-docx python-pptx pytesseract pillow
    ```
    These packages mirror the imports used in `backend/utils/text_extractor.py`. Install any additional dependencies you enable in that script (for example, `torch`, `sentence-transformers`, or `openai`). For OCR, install the Tesseract binary inside WSL (`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`) or point `pytesseract` to the Windows installation path.

11. **Expose the Ollama/LM Studio port to WSL**. Ollama already binds on `localhost`, which is reachable from WSL 2. If you run LM Studio, make sure it listens on all interfaces or specifically on `127.0.0.1`.

12. **Start the backend** (WSL terminal in `/backend`):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The Express server launches on `http://localhost:4000`. When a chat request arrives, you should now see tokens streamed back to the browser in real time rather than a static “جارٍ الرد...” indicator.

13. **Start the frontend** (separate WSL terminal in `/frontend`):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Vite starts on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API calls to the backend. Open the URL in any browser on Windows.

14. **Log in and test streaming chat**:
    - Register a test user via the API or seed the database.
    - Sign in on the React app.
    - Send a prompt—the assistant bubble will fill token-by-token as the backend proxies streamed chunks from Ollama.

15. **Optional: keep services running automatically**. For 24/7 availability use PM2 (Node) inside WSL and configure the Ollama/LM Studio service to start with Windows. Schedule `node backend/cronDelete.js` or rely on the built-in cron job to purge expired uploads.

### Launch checklist (Windows)

In summary, each time you power on the workstation:

1. Start Ollama or LM Studio on Windows and make sure the desired model is loaded.
2. Open Ubuntu (WSL) and run `npm run dev` inside `/backend`.
3. In another WSL shell, run `npm run dev` inside `/frontend`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:5173`, log in, and interact with the assistant.

## Testing Checklist

* `npm run dev` (backend) – verifies Express boots and database migrations execute.
* `npm run dev` (frontend) – ensures Vite builds the SPA.
* Sample file upload (≤2.5 MB) – validates Python extractor and DB write.
* Chat interaction – confirms Ollama connectivity and memory persistence.
